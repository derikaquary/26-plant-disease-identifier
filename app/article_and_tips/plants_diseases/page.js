      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <h2 className="text-3xl">1. Powdery Mildew</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
          Powdery mildew appears as white or gray powdery spots on leaves,
          stems, and flowers. It thrives in warm, dry conditions and can spread
          rapidly, causing leaves to yellow, curl, and eventually drop.
        </p>
        <h3>Treatment: </h3>
        <p>
          Remove Infected Parts: Prune and dispose of affected leaves and stems
          to prevent the spread.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fungicidal Spray: Apply a fungicidal spray made from neem oil or a
          solution of baking soda and water (1 tablespoon baking soda to 1
          gallon of water) to affected areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improve Air Circulation: Space plants properly and prune to increase
          airflow around the plant.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention: </h3>
        <p>
          Watering: Water plants at the base rather than overhead to keep
          foliage dry.
        </p>
        <p>Plant Resistance: Choose resistant plant varieties when possible.</p>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-2">
        <h2 className="text-3xl">2. Blight</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
          Blight, particularly late blight, is a fast-spreading disease that
          affects tomatoes, potatoes, and other plants. It presents as dark,
          water-soaked spots on leaves, stems, and fruit, leading to a rapid
          decline in plant health.
        </p>
        <h3>Treatment: </h3>
        <p>
          Remove Infected Plants: Immediately remove and destroy infected plants
          to prevent the spread of blight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fungicidal Treatment: Apply a copper-based fungicide at the first sign
          of disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soil Management: Avoid planting susceptible plants in the same spot
          each year to reduce soil-borne spores.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention: </h3>
        <p>
          Crop Rotation: Rotate crops yearly to prevent the buildup of blight
          spores in the soil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Proper Watering: Water at the base of plants and avoid wetting
          foliage.

        <h2 className="text-3xl">3. Root Rot</h2>
        <h3>Description: </h3>
        <p>
          Root rot is caused by overwatering and poor drainage, leading to a
          fungal infection that affects the roots. Infected plants may wilt,
          have yellowing leaves, and stunted growth. The roots will appear brown
          or black and mushy.
        </p>
        <h3>Treatment: </h3>
        <p>
          Improve Drainage: Ensure soil has proper drainage, and avoid
          overwatering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fungicidal Treatment: Treat the soil with a fungicide specifically
          designed for root rot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Replanting: If root rot is advanced, remove the affected plant, treat
          the soil, and replant with fresh, healthy plants.
        </p>
        <h3>Prevention: </h3>
        <p>
          Soil Conditions: Use well-draining soil and containers with drainage
          holes.
        </p>
        <p>Watering Practices: Allow the soil to dry out between waterings.</p>
